> DUAL RETINA FOR CONCURRENT VISION 	(Jan'16)

For a really fast vision the different visual processing levels have to run in parallel.

For this requeriment a dual retina scheme needs to be used: 
- a dynamic retina, for continuous image segmentation (by far the most CPU intensive process)
- a static retina, for the rest of processes (peripheral vision, binding & recognition)



> MULTI-THREADED SEGMENTATION 	(Jan'16)

The retinal vision level is in charge of segmenting the image into regions. 

It must work fast, not slower than 10 fps.

To meet this speed the segmentation process must be done in a multi-threaded way.

4 Segmenter objects will work in paralel extracting regions and adding them to the dynamic retina.

Meanwhile, the main Segmentation thread will go computing the covariances of every new extracted region. 

When all Segmenters are done, the dynamic retina will be cloned into the static one, and a new segmentation process will be launched.




> PERIPHERAL VISION FOR MOVEMENT PERCEPTION		(Feb'16)

The peripheral vision level is in charge of perceiving movement in the scene.

It must also work fast, not slower than 10 fps.

Its output will be a set of ROIs, visual entities that represent real physical elements.

ROIS have a life and history and each one is associated to an extracted region.

They have the following features:
- a body
- a motion
- a position in space
- an existence in time

ROIs are the basic elements from which visual objects will be formed.



> BINDING  (OBJECT FORMATION)		(Feb'16)

The binding level is in charge of visual objects formation.

It relays on extracted regions & ROIs to conform objects with an own life.

The binding will be done grouping ROIs that accomplish the following requirements:
- share a space neighbourhood
- share a coherent motion
