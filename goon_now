I'm working in the peripheral vision system now.

It's being redesigned to use it for movement perception. 

It relies on the following assumption:
- changes in the real world are continuous 
- that's because object movements are also continuous
- so, if frames are processed fast enough, extracted regions will keep similar color, shape and position in consecutive frames

Tasks:

- monitor old peripheral vision system
