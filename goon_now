> Present task: new merge (retinal vision)

The multi-threaded segmentation produces image oversegmentation. 

Therefore, the merge stage has to be recovered (was disabled long time ago).

Merge to be updated and tested.


> Next task: new peripheral vision

Redesigned to use it for movement perception. 

It relies on the following assumption:
- changes in the real world are continuous because object movements are continuous
- if frames processed fast enough, regions will keep similar color, shape and position in consecutive frames
