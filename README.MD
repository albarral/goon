goon is a family of C++ libraries (linux) oriented to robotic vision applications.

It is aimed at offering high level functionalities for different stages of the visual process:
- color perception
- retinal vision 
- peripheral vision
- visual binding
- visual recognition

It is based in the opencv API. A well known open source API developed by Intel and Willow Garage intended for visual processing and machine learning applications. 

The goon package is composed by:
- look executable
- goon_utils library (libgoon_utils)
- vision_data library (libgoon_data)
- features library (libgoon_features)
- retinal_vision library (libgoon_retinal)
- peripheral_vision library (libgoon_peripheral)
- camera library (libgoon_camera)
- monitor library (libgoon_monitor)
- show library (libgoon_show)


And has the following dependencies:
- log4cxx (logging library)
- opencv core (libopencv_core)
- opencv highgui (libopencv_highgui)
- opencv imgproc (libopencv_imgproc)
