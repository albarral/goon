# goon

This repo holds software code for the goon project.

goon is a family of C++ libraries intended for the development of robotic vision applications in Linux environments. 

It is aimed to offer high level visual processing functionalities for every stage of the visual process:
- color perception
- retinal vision 
- peripheral vision
- visual binding
- visual recognition

It is based in the opencv API. A well known open source API developed by Intel and Willow Garage intended for visual processing and machine learning applications. 

The set of libraries offered by the API are:
libgoon_utils.so
libgoon_data.so
libgoon_retinal.so
libgoon_peripheral.so
libgoon_binding.so
libgoon_recognition.so

By now (january 2016) the goon project is in early developmental stage.
